## Weather App
* This app contains all the stuff I've learned throughout the bootcamp from the simplest things like layouts to Navigation component to other complicated things like Flow. You can say it's kind of my magnum opus.
* Retrofit2, OkHttp3, MVVM pattern, LiveData and Single Activity/Multi Fragments architecture have been used extensively. I've used LiveData for connection checking as well.
* Coroutines and Flow have been used for multi-threading.
* Dependency injection has been implemented using Koin.
* Room DB has been used as data storage.
* Unit testing has been implemented for one function in Repository and ViewModel layers respectively.
* WorkManager has been used for refreshing locations.
